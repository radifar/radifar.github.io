Quite often, we fall under the assumption that interaction happen between two bodies. For example, we often curious about the interaction between a drug and a receptor, an enzyme and its inhibitor, protein and DNA, antibody and antigen, and many more. What some (or many) of us failed to notice is how important intramolecular (one body) interaction and many ways interaction. Fassio et.al. (2022) demonstrate how EIFP outperform two other IFP representation then pointed out that it is important to note that EIFP incorporate intraresidue interaction and although
