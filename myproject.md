Most of my projects are related to molecule and software engineering.
Right now I'm into web-based application for molecular modeling and
molecular simulation, especially in workflow development and data analysis.

# My Past Project

* **PyPLIF**  
  Python-based Protein Ligand Interaction Fingerprinting.

# My Current Project

* **PyPLIF HIPPOS**  
  HIPPOS Is PyPLIF On Steroids.

# The Future

* **HIPPOS GUI**  
  Develop web-based GUI for HIPPOS.
* **GARUDA-DOCK**  
  Molecular docking tools with our *secret recipe* AKA
our own *Scoring Function*. Will try to write it in Python for faster
development. But if too slow when applied for virtual screening it will
be written in C++ instead.
